# Fine-tune pre-trained model in Tensorflow
By using our code, we reproduce the results of three popular fine-grained benchmarks.(i.e., Bird, Aircrafts and Cars) We will keep updating the results of this page.

## Our experiments are running on
* Tensorflow2.0.0b0<br>
* 1 Ã— 1080<br>
* Cuda 10.0 with CuDNN 7.5<br>
# Results (top-1 accuracy rates, %)
All the reproduced results use neither bounding boxes nor part annotations, and the SVM classifier is not performed.
